# Assessment Junior Developer
_Frontend Developer - Labkafe_

## Problem Statement-
Labkafe’s web development team has been working on a new "Career Page". The lead designer suggested to redesign and restructure the existing page from scratch. 

The backend team has been working on the ContactUs API which helps the end user to fill forms throughout the website and collect form data as efficiently as possible. You have been given the responsibility to complete the frontend as well as backend for the "Career Page". The UI Designer has provided you with the Desktop version of the UI ("Career Page.png") and required graphic assets for reference which will help you replicate the desired end product ("UI" folder of this repository).

The UI consists of a dropdown menu as well as a static side bar with individual behaviors for "on click" events, which has been tried to be represented by the UI Screens provided.

## Key Points for evaluation- 
1.	The UI does not require any specific technology to be used, the developer is given freedom to use any technology/libraries/frameworks with which he/she is comfortable. Even implementation with plain HTML, CSS, JS will be accepted.  
2.  There is no compulsion to use everything provided in the assets folder, Images/Text/Icons given in the UI can be changed with anything which is accessible to the developer. The Color Scheme however should be maintained. 
3.	The submitted UI needs to be complete in every sense, incomplete UI will not be accepted. Only "dev" versions will be accepted, "build" submisisons will be automatically rejected. A readme file with build instructions will be helpful.
4.	The given UI is given in screen snapshot and does not represent any motion or animation. This is up to the developer to improvise on and use his/her creativity for animations.
5.	 Since “responsive design” is one of the key skills required for this role. The developer is expected to implement and think of a suitable mobile version for the same page. The UI for mobile screens may be completely built from scratch, keeping the intended functionality intact. This sub-part of the task is to give us a taste of “design sense” of the developer.

## (Optional)-
6.	 The backend being trivial for this task, is preferred in PHP, but working with NodeJS to collect and record data is also accepted. Use a MySQL database to store data. Any basic implementation of backend will be accepted.
